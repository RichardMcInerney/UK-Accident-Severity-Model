UK Road Accident Severity Prediction & Risk Scoring

End-to-end machine learning project using the UK Road Safety STATS19 dataset (2005–2016) to predict accident severity (Slight / Serious / Fatal) and generate risk scores for high-risk conditions.

Built in Google Colab with Pandas, Scikit-learn (Random Forest), and exported predictions for combined Power BI integration.

Project Components

ML Model & Notebook - Full pipeline: data loading, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, risk scoring  
  (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vqii9QUbvKtfqTeXTsXzLlxNLhW5O3m3?usp=sharing)  
  
Accuracy:  83.8% - Key drivers: Speed limit, Time of day, Weather

Confusion Matrix - Model performance visualisation  
  (See screenshot in repo root)

Power BI Dashboard (Screenshots):  
  Interactive analysis of raw accident data (full .pbix file available upon request due to GitHub size limits)
  
Pages: Executive Overview, Time & Conditions, Driver & Vehicle Risk, Risk Drivers, Model Performance, Strategic Insights  

Business Value

- Predicts high-risk accidents before they happen  
- Identifies patterns (night-time, high speeds, adverse weather) for targeted safety interventions  
- Supports insurers, police, councils, and transport agencies with data-driven decisions

How to Run the Model

1. Open the notebook link above  
2. Run all cells (Kaggle download may require manual CSV upload if API token fails)
